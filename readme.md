# Last User Orders by Roles

## Description

This tool is especially useful for store managers who need to keep track of customer engagement and adjust user roles automatically based on purchasing activity.

## Features

- **Display Last Order Date**: Shows the last order date for each user directly in the WordPress admin.
- **Role Management**: Easily changes user roles based on the time elapsed since their last order.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust the months of inactivity required to trigger a role change, manage user display settings, and more.

## Installation

1. **Download the Plugin**:
   - Download the zip file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MrGKanev/Last-User-Orders-by-Roles).
2. **Install the Plugin**:
   - Navigate to your WordPress admin panel.
   - Go to Plugins > Add New.
   - Click on 'Upload Plugin' and select the zip file.
   - Activate the plugin after the installation.
3. **Enjoy it**:

## Usage

After installation and activation:

- Navigate to `WooCommerce > User Orders by Role` to view and manage settings.
- Set parameters such as the "Months Difference" for considering a user inactive, the default role for inactive users, and how many users to display per page.
- Use the added submenu under WooCommerce to manage and view user roles and order activities.

## Use Cases and Examples

- **Store Managers**: Automatically change user roles based on the time elapsed since their last order. In my case, a client wanted something to see if a Wholesale order was last placed X months ago and if it wasn't, he would be assigned a customer role.
- **Customer Engagement**: Keep track of customer engagement and adjust user roles automatically based on purchasing activity.

## Configuration

To configure the plugin, go to the WooCommerce settings page, find the 'User Orders by Role' tab, and adjust the settings:

- **Months Difference**: Number of months to check for order inactivity.
- **Default Role**: Role to assign to users who haven't ordered within the specified time.
- **Users Per Page**: Number of users to display per administration page.
